# Rust Fortran Compiler

fortran compiler written in rust with  cranelift backend 


## Why?
Well, i recently started my journey with compiler/interpreters and this kind of staff. After vacation break  at school i didn't have any idea what kind of project to write. Why not to write the first wide used language compiler?


## RoadMap
